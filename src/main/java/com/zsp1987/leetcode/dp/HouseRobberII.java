 * After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new
 * place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time,
 * all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house
 * is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these
 * houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.
 * 
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of
 * each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without
 * alerting the police.
